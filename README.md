## Project Description

Many people around the world follow European football. Our website contains information about Europe's top five football leagues. In addition to that, our website provides updates on scores, match dates, player stats, and also some interesting betting games. 

To keep football fans entertained, we also provide a gaming feature for users where they can play a guessing game and earn coins, which they can then use to upgrade their regular account to a premium account and gain access to more advanced features. These advanced features include letting users follow their favorite players so they can access their information easily.  We also let usersÂ searchÂ players.
